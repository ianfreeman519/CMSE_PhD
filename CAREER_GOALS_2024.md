# Career Goals as of 2024

## Questions from Brian

### How do you think things have gone over the past year? (With regards to research, courses, etc. - basically everything)

Looking back, I think they have gone very well. Of course while I was actively taking the courses I didn't love them, but with the power of retrospect I am proud of what I accomplished (with respect to coursework). I am 60% of the way done with coursework for the PhD, which is a very comfortable place to be.

That said, with respect to research, I am a little disappointed with the progress I have made over the past year. I came in with the thought process of 'while I am on UDF funding, I should grind out as much coursework as I can, and pick up research afterwards...' I did that, but going to conferences and HEDSS humbled me because (for lack of a better phrasing for it) I feel behind the 'competition.'

### What's your next big graduate school milestone, and what do you have to do in order to prepare for it?

I would like to publish a paper. I know that graduating with a PhD is largely dependent on publishing results, and I want to start work on cranking one out. I think the path of least resistance is collaboration, but I'm not sure where to begin. Maybe solving the MARZ problem on a publically facing code could be a good place to start?

In order to actually create a publication, though, I need to contribute a lot more science than I currently am. I hope that the lighter courseload in the summer is a good start, but I think there are still some gaps in my knowledge I should close before heading down that route. Namely Reimann solvers, and how to write science papers.

### Is there anything specific from last year that you want to change or do differently this year?

I need to improve my schedule. Some days I work from home, and some days I come into the office, with (sometimes) unorthodox combinations of the two. The flexibility is glorious, but my work-life balance swings wildly from side to side.

### Are you happy in grad school so far?

Overall yes. It is easy to lose sight of the destination which makes the journey difficult, especially in the middle of last year when I was taking so many classes. Now that I am out of the coursework jungle, I am really enjoying research and grinding through simulations and data.

### At the moment, what are your long-term career plans? What's totally off the table, and what is your backup plan in case Plan A goes awry?

I am not *entirely* sure still. I lean more towards national lab work, but I would still kind of like to stay in the midwest (which is difficult in this field...). Simultaneously I lean away from national lab work because of the heavy emphasis on weapons applications. I'm still working through some of those things, and need to do some soul searching on it.

### What is your goal for your next job? (i.e., your first post-PhD position)

I'm also not *entirely* sure on this one. I have been doing some thinking about it, and I think a good start would be a fixed-term professorship somewhere in the midwest (maybe MSU if the opportunity presents itself). I only say this because I want to make sure there isn't too much pressure to start a lifelong career until I'm ready for it and know what I want.

### Where would you like to be in five years? (And what do you think should be done to ensure that you get there?)

I would like to be done with the PhD in five years. I really want to hunker down and grind through the research required for the dissertation so I can finish as soon as possible.

### What are your priorities for the next year of grad school in terms of:
#### **Research**

#### **Teaching opportunities (including teaching workshops, etc.)**
#### **Taking classes (in Physics & Astronomy, CMSE, or other departments)**

I'm taking stat mech, and want to spend much less time on classwork this semester than I did last year. I really am enjoying the research and want to keep up the momentum I'm building after ZFS.

#### **Internships/other opportunities**

We should look into this for next summer. I have very little preferences as far as internship opportunities go.

#### **Networking opportunities**

I would like to go to DPP in October, because I got a lot out of ZFS. Being surrounded by professionals in the field is mentally really helpful to orient priorities toward the future.

### Do you want to get any additional teaching experience before you graduate? (Or pursue the Graduate Teaching Certificate?)

I don't know what these are, or the purposes of them. I'm interested, but if I do go to a fixed term for a time after I graduate, I think it will bolster the CV/Resume similarly.

### What types of Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (RECR; https://grad.msu.edu/recr) training would you like to get this year?

Last semester there were RCR courses I was automatically enrolled in that were D2L discussion boards. I had hoped that this would happen again, but if I have to attend my own, I would probably choose the Record Keeping Data Management and Sharing information (RCR 3628-ILTVC) in December, and the Non-Disclosure Agreements IP and Export Controls (RCR 3648-ILTVC) in April.

### Are there any things I can do to help you succeed that I'm not currently doing?

Not really, and I do mean that sincerely and honestly. If there was an advisor competition I think you would take gold. If possible, I think I would benefit from shorter but more frequent research meetings. I know you are only putting advising meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays this semester, but in the future I would like to try two 30 minute meetings per week rather than a singular hour meeting per week.

### Is there anything else on your mind that you want to talk about?

1. Git. I don't understand it, and have never really been formally trained. I was hoping Parallel Computing would teach it to me, but the idea of branching, forking, and version control in general is a mystery to me.

2. Future research projects. While I enjoy thinking about MARZ, I would like to explore some other things, and explore ML/AI models as they relate to fluid models as well.

3. Overall, I think things over in CMSE are going well, and the machine is starting to whir back into a cadence again which is very nice. I am worried about TA workload, but I think I will manage regardless.

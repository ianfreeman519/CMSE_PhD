# CMSE_PhD
Holding place for the research I will complete, notes I take, and projects I work on during my PhD.

I will try to be diligent in explaining which files and directories store what information and why in this document, but I am notoriously bad at keeping records. This is my attempt to fix that shortcoming.

### template_files directory
Here I'm going to store all the files I find useful on the internet that are good starting places for certain things. For example, markdown files are new to me, so the example_markdown.md file is a markdown file with a bunch of examples of neat things I can do in a markdown file.

### NOTES.md
Here I'm going to track all the things I am working on in my coding adventures so when I need to refer back to the things I worked on, I can. This will be helpful for debugging purposes, but also helpful for the sake of keeping good records.
